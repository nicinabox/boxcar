Alright, chums here it is: 0.3.0. This was intended to just be a patch release originally, but there were over 60 commits--mostly bugfixes--waiting to go out. Due to some backward incompatible changes, I decided to go up to 0.3.0.

Changelog: [https://github.com/nicinabox/boxcar/releases/tag/0.3.0](https://github.com/nicinabox/boxcar/releases/tag/0.3.0)

## Install

```
bash <(curl -s http://boxcar.nicinabox.com/install)
```

## Upgrading from 0.2.x

There are some major changes to how boxcar gets distributed and installed in 0.3.0. To make sure you get a nice clean install, remove your existing install first (future releases do this automatically).

```
boxcar server:stop
removepkg boxcar
rm -rf /boot/extra/boxcar*
```
