Unintuitive. Odd choices of information to display and ways to display it (i.e some very in depth system output - but just dumped straight out). 

Very difficult to approach it with the idea 'I want to do X' and see immediately how to do it. Far, far too many free form text boxes for complicated syntax entering.

Has to be 'approved' by joel (?) before it can make it in there formally. Not an obvious process.

Feels like we're heavily reinventing the wheel (slackware already has a package management system yet here we are manually rolling our own packages on top..) and no proper central package repository.

Were this RedHat (or equivalent) or Ubuntu it would seem clear we would push for a community yum repo or ppa though who and how that would be stewarded would be a sticking point.

Slackware, I believe (not as familiar) has analogous repo / package maintenance systems. I don't know why we're not using them (actually I can guess, but it's probably not for discussion here ;) ).

","Honestly? Not an interface one really.

Stop (or make it optional) unraid being it's own distro. Port / maintain it for a more common distribution(s) and provide a yum / ppa to install it (emhttp and a kernel module) on any old machine. Let the distros do the heavy work of the packages and fluff around the unraid core instead of spending most of the time battling that in development and retreading it all.

I can understand why that would be difficult and why having it as an 'appliance' is beneficial but it feels like it's being dragged down under it's own weight right now.

So a middle ground, as above - having as part of the core a maintained package management system which we can have a community repo spun off from. Not a homebrewed one preferably a 'standard' one that is widely used already in slackware.

slapt-get? sbopkg? not sure if any of them would do it.

unmenu comes close but it's not true package management / reinvents the wheel / the gatekeepers are..well..."

Unrelated to the interface: It's ridiculous that unRaid doesn't include ssh by default. Telnet has been deprecated for more than a decade. I would like a second parity drive. I want a filesystem with built-in integrity checking (Btrfs, ZFS) -- if there's a bit error, how do you know if it's the parity or the data that's bad. Support drive upgrade paths that don't require blowing away parity or just trusting it. Upgrade unRaid from the UI. Opt-in automatic error reporting (?).
