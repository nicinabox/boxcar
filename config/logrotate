# example logrotate config file, I usually keep this in
# /etc/logrotate.d/unicorn_app on my Debian systems
#
# See the logrotate(8) manpage for more information:
#    http://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate

# Modify the following glob to match the logfiles your app writes to:
/home/example/deploy/tmp/log/*.log {
  # this first block is mostly just personal preference, though
  daily
  missingok
  rotate 180
  compress
  dateext

  # this is important if using "compress" since we need to call
  # the "lastaction" script below before compressing:
  delaycompress

  # note the lack of the evil "copytruncate" option in this
  # config.  Unicorn supports the USR1 signal and we send it
  # as our "lastaction" action:
  lastaction
    # assuming your pid file is in /var/run/unicorn_app/pid
    pid=/home/web/deploy/tmp/unicorn.pid
    test -s $pid && kill -USR1 "$(cat $pid)"
  endscript
