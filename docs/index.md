# Docs

This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Boxcar.

## What is Boxcar?

Boxcar is a tool for managing an unRAID instance. It was designed to superceed older tools that grew out of the unRAID community. It's built with Ruby and Sinatra and slew of modern web technologies.

A web interface and a command line tool are included. They are powered by a single backend API. It also has [addons](addons) built in.

At its current iteration, Boxcar only includes an interface for managing addons. Features will grow as the project matures ([see the roadmap](roadmap)).
