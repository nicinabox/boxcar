This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Boxcar.

## What is Boxcar?

Boxcar is a tool for managing an unRAID instance. It's designed to superceed older tools that grew out of the unRAID community. It's built with Ruby and Sinatra using a slew of modern web technologies. Boxcar is a web interface and a command line tool. It has support for addons built in.

At its current iteration, Boxcar only includes an interface for managing addons. Features will grow as the project matures ([see the roadmap](roadmap)).
