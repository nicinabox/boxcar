# Boxcar

A modern, responsive admin interface for unRAID. Built with Sinatra and Bootstrap, it's designed with the user in mind, the way a web app should be.

## Project goals

This is a rather ambitious project. Like others, I was impressed by what unRAID has to offer, but found the management utility lacking in the design department (all aspects of design, including code, architecture, organization, user experience, interface, et al).

Goals:

* An interface designed for the user with feedback from the community
* Works across multiple platforms and devices
* A clean, organized codebase
* Test driven where possible
* Lower the bar for the community to read, fork, and contribute changes back to the project

This is not a skin, theme, or "redesign" of the exising webGui.

## Parts

Boxcar includes a web app and CLI tool. Addons are baked in.
